# Netlify-website-clone
Netlify website Clone developed usig HTML and CSS, but added little bit of Java Script.
<br>
<br>
<strong>steps to understand the project<strong>:
<br>
<br>
if u are using a visual studio code follow steps:
<br>
<br>
/**
<br>
<br>
1.Create the HTML file in your VS Code and copy the HTML code from repository.
<br>
<br>
2.Also Create the CSS file in your VS Code and copy the CSS code from repository.
<br>
<br>
3.Also Create the JS file in your VS Code and copy the JS code from repository.
<br>
<br>
4.Don't connect any CSS, JS file externally.
<br>
<br>
5.If u want to change the file name, then u have to connect that file externally. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

I have added only 2 javascript functionality.
<br>
<br>
1.If u want to see javascript functionally, click on the signup button, in navigation bar the color of the content will change and also background color of the body will change.
<br>
<br>
2. If u want to see another javascript functionality, click on the explore platform button, it will re-direct to my One Plus web page.
